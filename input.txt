# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

New Harmonics is a music sharing web app where users can register either as artists or listeners. Artists can upload songs with basic metadata (title, album, genre), while all users can browse and play music. The system includes a basic dashboard that displays popular songs and tracks from artists the current user is following. Users can also download or like songs in order to save them and get notifications regarding the latest uploads of their followings.
